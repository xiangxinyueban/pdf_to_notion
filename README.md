# pdf_to_notion
Convert PDFs to notion pages.

I always have the requirement to read the PDF. But my PDFs stored in multiple folders. It's difficult to find those PDFs. And the same time I use the notion to note everything I learned. Notion is easy to use and the search function is very helpful. So I think is there any way to import the PDFs to notions.
我想把我下载的PDF以notion笔记的方式导入到notion中，目前许多在线的PDF转Markdown网站，只能支持简单的文字转换，并且会丢失图片并且丢失原格式。我自己写一个工具来将PDF以接近原格式的方式建立notion pages。
